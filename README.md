The tutorial is forcing me to do this
My name is Taffy. I'm 15 years old. My house is in the northwast section of Huddersfield, where all the houses are, and I am not married. I work as an student in Heckmondwike Grammar School, and I get home every day by 5:30 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink coffee. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get seven hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of cold water and doing about twenty minutes of gaming before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
